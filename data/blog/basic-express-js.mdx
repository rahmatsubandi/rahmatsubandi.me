## Step One

### The first step when you want to use Express Js is:

Open the website [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

Then open to Terminal

typing:

```shell:terminal
npm install express --save
```

To run it, namely by:

```shell:terminal
node .\app.js
```

And to use a server that automatically restarts every time there is a change, you need to install Nodemon

how to type:

```shell:terminal
npm install -g nodemon
```

The -g function is a global server, so you can access it anywhere

Then to run the server, type:

```shell:terminal
nodemon.cmd .\app.js
```

But don't forget that even though using nodemon we have to refresh the browser

To use an ejs template please open this link [EJS](https://ejs.co/#install)

How to install it:

```shell:terminal
npm install ejs
```
