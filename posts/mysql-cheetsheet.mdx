### Cheatsheet

Access monitor:

```sql:bash
mysql -u [username] -p;
// (will prompt for password)
```

Show all databases:

```sql:bash
show databases;
```

Access database:

```sql:bash
mysql -u [username] -p [database]
// (will prompt for password)
```

Create new database:

```sql:bash
create database [database];
```

Select database:

```sql:bash
use [database];
```

Determine what database is in use:

```sql:bash
select database();
```

Show all tables:

```sql:bash
show tables;
```

Show table structure:

```sql:bash
describe [table];
```

List all indexes on a table:

```sql:bash
show index from [table];
```

Create new table with columns:

```sql:bash
CREATE TABLE [table] ([column] VARCHAR(120), [another-column] DATETIME);
```

Adding a column:

```sql:bash
ALTER TABLE [table] ADD COLUMN [column] VARCHAR(120);
```

Adding a column with an unique, auto-incrementing ID:

```sql:bash
ALTER TABLE [table] ADD COLUMN [column] int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY;
```

Inserting a record:

```sql:bash
INSERT INTO [table] ([column], [column]) VALUES ('[value]', '[value]');
```

MySQL function for datetime input:

```sql:bash
NOW()
```

Selecting records:

```sql:bash
SELECT * FROM [table];
```

Explain records:

```sql:bash
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM [table];
```

Selecting parts of records:

```sql:bash
SELECT [column], [another-column] FROM [table];
```

Counting records:

```sql:bash
SELECT COUNT([column]) FROM [table];
```

Counting and selecting grouped records:

```sql:bash
SELECT *, (SELECT COUNT([column]) FROM [table]) AS count FROM [table] GROUP BY [column];
```

Selecting specific records:

```sql:bash
SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [column] = [value];
// (Selectors: <, >, !=; combine multiple selectors with AND, OR)
```

Select records containing `[value]`:

```sql:bash
SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [column] LIKE '%[value]%';
```

Select records starting with `[value]`:

```sql:bash
SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [column] LIKE '[value]%';
```

Select records starting with `val` and ending with `ue`:

```sql:bash
SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [column] LIKE '[val_ue]';
```

Select a range:

```sql:bash
SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [column] BETWEEN [value1] and [value2];
```

Select with custom order and only limit:

```sql:bash
SELECT * FROM [table] WHERE [column] ORDER BY [column] ASC LIMIT [value];
// (Order: DESC, ASC)
```

Updating records:

```sql:bash
UPDATE [table] SET [column] = '[updated-value]' WHERE [column] = [value];
```

Deleting records:

```sql:bash
DELETE FROM [table] WHERE [column] = [value];
```

Delete _all records_ from a table (without dropping the table itself):

```sql:bash
DELETE FROM [table];
// (This also resets the incrementing counter for auto generated columns like an id column.)
```

Delete all records in a table:

```sql:bash
truncate table [table];
```

Removing table columns:

```sql:bash
ALTER TABLE [table] DROP COLUMN [column];
```

Deleting tables:

```sql:bash
DROP TABLE [table];
```

Deleting databases:

```sql:bash
DROP DATABASE [database];
```

Custom column output names:

```sql:bash
SELECT [column] AS [custom-column] FROM [table];
```

Export a database dump (more info [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21091197/1815847)):

```sql:bash
mysqldump -u [username] -p [database] > db_backup.sql
```

Use `--lock-tables=false` option for locked tables (more info [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/104628/1815847)).

Import a database dump (more info [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21091197/1815847)):

```sql:bash
mysql -u [username] -p -h localhost [database] < db_backup.sql
```

Logout:

```sql:bash
exit;
```

## Aggregate functions

Select but without duplicates:

```sql:bash
SELECT distinct name, email, acception FROM owners WHERE acception = 1 AND date >= 2015-01-01 00:00:00;
```

Calculate total number of records:

```sql:bash
SELECT SUM([column]) FROM [table];
```

Count total number of `[column]` and group by `[category-column]`:

```sql:bash
SELECT [category-column], SUM([column]) FROM [table] GROUP BY [category-column];
```

Get largest value in `[column]`:

```sql:bash
SELECT MAX([column]) FROM [table];
```

Get smallest value:

```sql:bash
SELECT MIN([column]) FROM [table];
```

Get average value:

```sql:bash
SELECT AVG([column]) FROM [table];
```

Get rounded average value and group by `[category-column]`:

```sql:bash
SELECT [category-column], ROUND(AVG([column]), 2) FROM [table] GROUP BY [category-column];
```

## Multiple tables

Select from multiple tables:

```sql:bash
SELECT [table1].[column], [table1].[another-column], [table2].[column] FROM [table1], [table2];
```

Combine rows from different tables:

```sql:bash
SELECT * FROM [table1] INNER JOIN [table2] ON [table1].[column] = [table2].[column];
```

Combine rows from different tables but do not require the join condition:

```sql:bash
SELECT * FROM [table1] LEFT OUTER JOIN [table2] ON [table1].[column] = [table2].[column];
// (The left table is the first table that appears in the statement.)
```

Rename column or table using an _alias_:

```sql:bash
SELECT [table1].[column] AS '[value]', [table2].[column] AS '[value]' FROM [table1], [table2];
```

## Users functions

List all users:

```sql:bash
SELECT User,Host FROM mysql.user;
```

Create new user:

```sql:bash
CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

Grant `ALL` access to user for `*` tables:

```sql:bash
GRANT ALL ON database.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
```

## Find out the IP Address of the Mysql Host

```sql:bash
SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'hostname';
```
